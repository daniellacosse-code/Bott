# gemini discord bot

Duplicate `app/.env.example` to `app/.env` and fill it out.

Then run:

```
cd app
deno task setup
deno task start
```

TODOs:

there's clearly a bug with the gemini history, i gotta look into that. some off by one thing (i rushed it)
add short cuts for image and video
music?
apply for person images?
maybe a note in /help that's like "i can only currently read text"
